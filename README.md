## Self Organizing Maps 

* An Introduction to SOM's
  A self-organizing map or self-organizing feature map is a type of artificial neural network that is trained using unsupervised learning   to produce a low-dimensional, discretized representation of the input space of the training samples, called a map, and is therefore a     method to do dimensionality reduction.
